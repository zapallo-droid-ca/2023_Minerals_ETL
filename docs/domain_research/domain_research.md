### Domain Research

## Introduction
To the construction of the ETL process some domain questions has been defined:

1. What are the critical minerals required for the clean energy transition?
2. What are the main producers of those minerals?
3. What are the main trade flows of those minerals?
4. What are the main sources of open data for those minerals production and trade?
5. What are the main producers and trade flows of the traditional energy vectors?
6. How the producer countries have changed?

**Minerals Used in the Energy Transition:**
The International Energy Agency is one of the most importat global institutions related to the energy field,
in the 2021 World Energy Outlook one special chapter has been developed about the role of the critical minerals
in Clean Energy Transition.

In the report, thei point two main categories for the minerals use segmentation:
* Minerals used in electric cars:

| **mineral** | **kg/vehicle in Electric Cars** | **kg/vehicle in Conventional Cars** |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| copper	  | 53.2 							| 22.3								  |
| lithium  	  | 8.9								| 0.0								  |
| nickel	  | 39.9							| 0.0								  |
| manganese	  | 24.5							| 11.2								  |
| cobalt      | 13.3							| 0.0								  |
| graphite    | 66.3							| 0.0								  |
| zinc        | 0.1								| 0.1								  |
| rare earths | 0.5								| 0.0								  |
| others      | 0.3								| 0.3								  |

Notes from Authors:
*Steel and aluminium not included. The values for vehicles are for the entire vehicle including batteries, motors and glider. 
*The intensities for an electric car are based on a 75 kWh NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) 622 cathode and graphite-based anode. 
*The values for offshore wind and onshore wind are based on the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator 
*system (including array cables) and the doubly-fed induction generator system respectively.

* Minerals used in energy technologies:

*Steel and aluminium not included. The values for offshore wind and onshore wind are based on the direct-drive permanent 
*magnet synchronous generator system (including array cables) and the doubly-fed induction generator system respectively. 
*The values for coal and natural gas are based on ultra-supercritical plants and combined-cycle gas turbines. 
*Actual consumption can vary by project depending on technology choice, project size and installation environment.
