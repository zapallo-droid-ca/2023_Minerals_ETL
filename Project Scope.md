## Sources Characteristics:

**Gelociocal Survey Mineral Commodity Summaries:**
This database contains the United States salient statistics and world production statistics for over 88 nonfuel mineral commodities. <br>
Salient statistics for the United States includes items such as production, imports, exports, price, stocks, apparent consumption, and/or net import reliance for nonfuel mineral commodities. <br>
The database contains two separate table files (entities) in CSV format: 
	1. Salient Statistics 
	2. World production. 

There are metadata files associated with these CSV files that describe the data.

World mineral statistics data
Welcome to the World Mineral Statistics archive data download page. The British Geological Survey (BGS) and its predecessor organisations have compiled production and trade statistics on a wide range of mineral commodities since 1913. As part of our ongoing work to make these data more accessible we have created an online tool which allows users to extract the data in Microsoft Excel format.

Data availability
Currently this tool permits access to data from the World Mineral Statistics archive for the years 1970 to 2021. Prior to 1970 the data are available in PDF files which you can download for free from the main archive page. Selected data from 1960 are also available from the main archive as a static table in MS Excel.

For certain commodities data are not available for all years, for example the BGS commenced collation of data for primary aggregates in 1998 and consequently there are no data for earlier years for this particular commodity. Trade data (imports and exports) are available for all countries up to 2002, and for selected European countries only from 2003 to 2018.
